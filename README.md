For data preprocession, we need the

Python package which can be installed via
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mne
```
or
```bash
pip install mne
```


## Data

ToDo:
- [ ] What kind of data is used?
- [ ] Where does it need to be located?

For using the scripts, please configure `config.toml` by copying the template `config.example.toml` and setting the directories accordingly.
